# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
A branch of computer science that deals with the design,development,testing and maintenance of software applications.
Software engineering is a comprehensive and structured approach to developing complex software systems, while traditional programming is more focused on the act of writing code to solve specific problems .
Software engineering requires a broader set of skills, rocesses and methodologies compared to traditional programming.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Design -detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are made.
implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the the design specifications.
Testing - done to check if sthe software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance - ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall model -sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall.
used mostly for short-term projects,
             while
Agile models -iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
mostly used for long term projects.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It is the process of eliciting,analyzing,documenting  and managing the requirements for a software system.
The process:
1. Requirements Elicitation-involves gathering information from sttakeholders, such as customers, users, domain experts and subject matter experts and subject matter experts to understand their needs, expectations and constraints for the software system.
2. Requirement Analysis - gathered requirements are analyzed to idntify any conflicts, dependencies or ambiiguities.
3. Requirements Specification - The requirements are then documented in a comprehensive requirements specification document , which serves as a reference point for the development team.
4. Requirements validation -The requirements specification is reviewed and validated to ensure that it acurately reflects the stakeholders' needs and that the requirements are clear, unambiguous, and testable
Importance:
Alignment wih stakeholders needs, reduced rework and costs, imroved quality and usability, effective communication and collaboration, traceability and testability.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a fundamental principle that involves breaking down a complex software system into smaller, self-contained, and reusable components or modules.
Improve maintainability:
Separation of concerns, Encapsulation, Testability, Ease of adaebugging
Improve Scalability
flexibility, reusability, parallel Development, Deployment
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing -testing the smallest testable parts of the application to verify tthe functionality of individual components or units of the software system
Integration testing -Ensuring that the individual components work together as expected when integrated to verify the interactions and interfaces between different software components or modules
System Testing - Testing the system as a whole including its end-end business processes and non-functional requirements to verify the overall functionality and performance of the complete, integrated software system
Acceptance Testing -Evaluating the system from the end-user's perspective and ensuring that it satisfies the acceptance criteria to verify that the software system meets the stakeholder's reqirements and is ready for deployment.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
VCS are tools that help manage changes to source code, documents and other files over time.
Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg Git, Sub Version
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects
Challenges:
Schedule and timeline management
Risk Management
Resource Allocation
Communication and Reporting
Team Dynamics and Motivation

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
It is the process of modifying and updating software systems after they have been delivered to the customer or deployed in the production environment.
Types:
1. Corrective maintenance- fixing bugs,errors, or defects in the software that were not identified during the initial development phase.
2. Adaptive maintenance - involves changing the software to accommodate changes in the operating environment
3. Perfective maintenance - enhancing the softwares functionality, performance or usability based on user feedback or new business requirements.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Fairness
Robustness
Transparency
Privacy
Explainability
How can they adhere

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
